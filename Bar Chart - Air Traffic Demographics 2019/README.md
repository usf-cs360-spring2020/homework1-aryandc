The "Mortgage Affordability, Rent Affordability, Price-to-Income Ratio" metric is described as:

  > *To calculate **mortgage affordability**, we first calculate the mortgage payment for the median-valued home in a metropolitan area.... Then, we consider what portion of the monthly median household income (U.S. Census) goes toward this monthly mortgage payment.... We calculate **rent affordability** similarly to mortgage affordability; however we use the Zillow Rent Index, which tracks the monthly median rent in particular geographical regions, to capture rental prices.*
